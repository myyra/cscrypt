# CScrypt

[Scrypt library](https://github.com/Tarsnap/scrypt) packaged for use with the Swift Package Manager.

See the [get-scrypt.sh](get-scrypt.sh) script for the modifications needed to make it compile. Mainly removing CPU optimization related files.

Tags reflect Scrypt versions.

Since the purpose of this package is to package the Scrypt source for Swift Package Manager, it will mainly be updated when new Scrypt versions come out. Please open an issue if I have missed a release.
